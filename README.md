## aleph
The ALEPH programming language

Aleph is a historical programming language; its name is an abbreviation for
**A** **L**anguage **E**ncouraging **P**rogram **H**iearachy.
This is an Aleph to C complier written in Aleph.

Files with extension `.ale` are Aleph source files.

* [c](c) The C code of the compiler and the linker as generated by the Aleph compiler
* [comp](comp) Modules of the module compiler (Aleph source)
* [link](link) Modules of the linker producing the target C file (Aleph source)
* [genc](genc) Aleph standard library file and C headers
* [doc](doc) Aleph Manual and some implementation details
* [sample](sample) Sample Aleph programs
* [bootstrap](bootstrap) C code of an early version of the compiler and linker; translated from Aleph to C by hand for bootstrap.

## Compiling the Aleph - C compiler

Compile the `comp.c` and `link.c` files from the [c](c) directory:

    gcc -O2 -I ../genc -o comp comp.c ../genc/A_lice.c
    gcc -O2 -I ../genc -o link link.c ../genc/A_lice.c
   

## Compiling, linking and running aleph files

The `comp` program produces `.ice` files from Aleph modules and the main Aleph file.
From the `.ice` files the C translation is generated by `link`. The `comp` program
needs the aleph standard library file `alib.ale`, which should be either in
the current directory, or the directory should be specified by the `-I` commnad-line
argument. The following commands, given in the main directory, compile, link,
and run the `ex2.ale` sample program

    c/comp -I genc -W ex/ex2  # generates ex2.ice
    c/link ex2.ice            # generates aleph.c which should be compiled
    gcc -I genc -o ex2 aleph.c genc/A_lice.c
    ./ex2                     # run it
    ./ex2 -T                  # run with trace sent to stderr
