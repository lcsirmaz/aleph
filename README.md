## aleph
The ALEPH programming language

Aleph is a historical programming language; its name is an abbreviation for
**A** **L**anguage **E**ncouraging **P**rogram **H**iearachy.
This is an Aleph to C complier written in Aleph.

Files with extension `.ale` are Aleph source files.

* [c](c) The C code of the compiler and the linker as generated by the Aleph compiler
* [comp](comp) Modules of the module compiler (Aleph source)
* [link](link) Modules of the linker producing the target C file (Aleph source)
* [genc](genc) Aleph standard library file and C headers
* [doc](doc) Aleph Manual and some implementation details
* [sample](sample) Sample Aleph programs
* [bootstrap](bootstrap) C code of an obsolete version of the compiler and linker; translated from Aleph to C by hand.
* [joe](joe) Joe syntax highlighter for Aleph programs with .ale extension

## Compiling the Aleph - C compiler

Compile the `acomp.c` and `alink.c` files in the [c](c) directory:

    gcc -O3 -I ../genc -o acomp acomp.c ../genc/A_lice.c
    gcc -O3 -I ../genc -o alink alink.c ../genc/A_lice.c
   
## Compiling, linking and running aleph files

The `acomp` program produces `.ice` files from Aleph modules and the main Aleph file.
From the `.ice` files the C translation is generated by `alink`. The `acomp` program
needs the aleph standard library file `alib.ale`, which should be either in
the current directory, or the directory should be specified by the `-I` commnad-line
argument. The following commands, given in the main directory, compile, link,
and run the `ex2.ale` aleph program from the [sample](sample) directory.

    c/acomp -I genc -W --trace=on sample/ex2  # generates ex2.ice
    c/alink -o ex2 ex2.ice     # generates ex2.c
    gcc -I genc -o ex2 ex2.c genc/A_lice.c
    ./ex2                     # run it
    ./ex2 -T                  # run with trace sent to stderr
