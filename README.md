## aleph
ALEPH programming language

Aleph is a historical programming language, an abbreviation for
*A* *L*anguage *E*ncouraging *P*rogram *H*iearachy.
This is an Aleph complier written in Aleph.

Files with extension `.ale` are Aleph source files.

* [c](c) The C code of the compiler and the linker
* [comp](comp) Module compiler (Aleph source)
* [doc](doc) Aleph Manual and some implementation details
* [genc](genc) Aleph standard library file and C headers
* [link](link) Linker producing the C target file (Aleph source)
* [sample](sample) Sample Aleph programs

## Creating the aleph compiler

Compile the `comp.c` and `link.c` files from the [c](c) directory:

   gcc -O2 -I ../genc -o comp comp.c ../genc/A_lice.c
   
   gcc -O2 -I ../genc -o link link.c ../genc/A_lice.c

## Compiling and linking aleph files

The `comp` program produces `.ice` files from modules and the main file.
From the `.ice` files the C source is generated by `link`. The `comp` program
needs the aleph standard library file `alib.ale`, which should be either in
the current directory, or the directory should be specified by the `-I` 
argument The following command, given in the main directory, compiles, links,
and runs the ex2.ale sample program

    c/comp -I genc -W ex/ex2  # generates ex2.ice
    c/link ex2.ice            # generates aleph.c
    gcc -I genc -o ex2 aleph.c genc/A_lice.c
    ./ex2                     # and run it
