## Creating the Aleph compiler

Compile the ''comp.c'' and ''link.c'' files from the [c](c) directory:

   gcc -O2 -I ../genc -o comp comp.c ../genc/A_lice.c
   gcc -O2 -I ../genc -o link link.c ../genc/A_lice.c

## Compiling and linking Aleph files

The ''comp'' program produces ''.ice'' files from modules and the main file.
From the ''.ice'' files the C source is generated by ''link''.
