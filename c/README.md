## Compiler and linker

The result of compiling the aleph [compiler](../comp) and the [linker](../link) to C is here.

These programs can be compiled to machine code by a C compiler, and then
they can be used to *recompile* the compiler again. The result should be the same.

The first version was compiled by hand; those programs are in [bootstrap](../bootstrap).
