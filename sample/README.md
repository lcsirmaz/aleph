* [Towers of Hanoi](ex1.ale) print moves as two-letter sequences: from pole, to pole
* [Towers of Hanoi](ex2.ale) with visual printing of disc arrangements
* [Symbolic derivation](ex3.ale) with pretty printing, derivatives of <i>x<sup>x</sup></i> and (<i>x</i>+1)/(<i>x</i>-1)
* [Quick sort](ex4.ale) sort a sample fixed size stack with equal elements
* [Permutations](ex5.ale) generate all permutations in lexicographic order
* [Permutations](ex6.ale) a more succint version of generating all permutations
* [Inverse Polish](ex7.ale) turn any input formula into postfix Polish notation
