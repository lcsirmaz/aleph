## Sample Aleph programs

* [Towers of Hanoi](ex1.ale) print moves as two-letter sequences: from pole, to pole
* [Towers of Hanoi](ex2.ale) with visual printing of disc arrangements
* [Symbolic derivation](ex3.ale) with ugly output: first and second derivatives of <i>x<sup>x</sup></i> and <i>x/x</i>
* [Quick sort](ex4.ale) sort a sample fixed size stack with equal elements
* [Permutations](ex5.ale) generate all permutations in lexicographic order
* [Permutations](ex6.ale) a more succint version of generating all permutations
* [Invers Polish](ex7.ale) turn any input formula into postfix Polish notation
* [Synbolic derivation](ex8.ale) with pretty printing, derivatives of <i>x<sup>x</sup></i> and (<i>x</i>+1)/(<i>x</i>-1)
* [Variable number of affixes](ex9.ale) with trace
* [Built-in constants](ex10.ale) such as `_rule_` or `_title_`
* [Side effects](ex11.ale) when the rule as a macro has different semantics
